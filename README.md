# Fruit Fly Wing Hair Genetics: Data & Analysis

Welcome to the repository for data, code, and statistical analyses supporting the study of gene effects on wing hairs of fruitflies. This work supplements the manuscript titled **"A role for Myo-II zipper and spaghetti squash in Gliotactin-dependent Drosophila melanogaster wing hair planar cell polarity"** (title subject to change during peer review).

Here you will find:
- **Data**: All datasets used in the study are located in the `/data` directory.
- **Analysis Code**: RMarkdown (`*.rmd`) files contain the statistical analyses and commentary. These scripts process the datasets and generate results.
- **Reports**: Compiled PDF files (`*.pdf`) are generated from the RMarkdown files. They provide readable summaries of the analyses and can be regenerated as needed.

Feel free to explore the repository to review the data, reproduce the analyses, or adapt the code for related research.
