# Data and Code
This repository hosts the data, code, and statistical analyses for an experiment on analyzing the effects of various genes on the wing hairs of fruitflies. 
This is supplemental to the main manuscript which is titled, "A role for Myo-II zipper and spaghetti squash in Gliotactin-dependent Drosophila melanogaster wing hair planar cell polarity". The title may be updated as the manuscript is peer-reviewed for publication.

The statistical analyses of the data can be read in the pdfs and the source code is available in the RMarkdown files.

The structure of the repository is simple:
- `/data`: this folder contains all datasets supporting the manuscript
- `*.rmd`: these are all of the Rcode files with some commentary that run statistical analyses on the datasets in `/data`
- `*.pdf`: these are the compiled pdfs of the .rmd files. They can freely be overwritten by knitting the rmd files again. These are included here to make the code and staistical analyses easy to follow.
