# Data and Code
This repository hosts the data, code, and statistical analyses for an experiment on analyzing the effects of gene interactions on the wingscores of fruitflies. 
This is supplemental to the main manuscript which is titled, "A role for Myo-II zipper and spaghetti squash in Gliotactin-dependent Drosophila melanogaster wing hair planar cell polarity". The title may be updated as the manuscript is peer-reviewed for publication.

The statistical analyses of the data can be read in the [final output pdf](/fruitflies_stats.pdf)

The main files are
- dataset in `.xlsx` format
- `R` code in `.rmd` file to reproduce the statistical analyses from the dataset
- the output pdf showing the relevant `R` code chunks with the output and interpretations.
